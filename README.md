Use <kbd>e1</kbd> to choose an output, and adjust the values with <kbd>e2</kbd> and <kbd>e3</kbd>. Simple. It's an atternuverter actually." The levels are also norns parameters, which you might want to map to MIDI or an OSC control surface.

Not really great for audio. Use it for CVy things, although as we know these are the same thing actually: dancing voltage.

## Ideas

- [ ] amplify?
- [ ] other routings?
- [ ] weirder name/concept?
- [ ] artier graphics?
- [ ] what should norns keys do on a mixer? momentary mute? toggel bipolar/unipolar, randomize?
- [ ] lfos? well there is already matrix mod
